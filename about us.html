            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Founded in 2008 by Mrs.Kevin Silva, The City Hospital began with a vision to provide exceptional care in a single building. Over the decades, we have expanded our facilities and services, incorporating cutting-edge technology and specialized departments to meet the evolving needs of our patients. Significant milestones, such as as the introduction of our state-of-the-art imaging center in 2012, the expansion of our services with the opening of a comprehensive cancer center in 2015, and the launch of our community health outreach program in 2019, have marked our journey and strengthened our commitment to medical excellence. Today, The City Hospital stands as a pillar of health and hope, dedicated to delivering compassionate care and advancing healthcare through innovation, all while honoring the principles and values established by our founders.
